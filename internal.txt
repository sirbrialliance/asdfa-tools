Tasks
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

- next:

	- global error handler shows any error to user

	- modules:
		- midi
			- each output box has the option to copy form an input, with or without delay
			- style the device grid
		- touch
		- browser info
			- IP, user agent, local ip, server ip, etc.
			- what http protocol we used to load the page (e.g. http/3)
			- browscap.ini

			- links:
				- acid test
				- https://html5test.com/
				- https://www.webrtc-experiment.com/DetectRTC/
		- basic webgl
			- spining cube thumb
			- something cool looking fractal for bigger
		- notes
		- time
			- device time and "simple" server time only for now
			- current epoch
		- user media
			- show all cameras in grid, tap to toggle
				- mirror, fullscreen, stop
			- show all mic inputs
				- histogram of input data
				- start/stop capture
			- show all outputs
				- button to toggle each mic, toggle 2s output delay
				- histogram shows our outputs (one per speaker?)
				- trigger 1-3 test audio clips
					- one must specifically output to each speaker
		- zz speaker test - redundant with user media

		- should just point About to Readme.md
		- and Code to the repo
		- fade in bg image?
		- maybe base bg image on epoch (hourly) for better caching?


	- first release

- issues
	- On a certain tablet, after I refresh it loads AND shows the loading throbber

Bugs
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Make DeviceModule order deterministic (module.getDeviceKeys(): string[])

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
Ideas
-------------------------------------------------------------------------

- framework/base
	- design: logo showing asdf a on keybaord to hint origin and help remind
	- maybe add a "go back" arrow next to the logo when not on the main page
	- Hit url for non extant module sends 404 but page loaded shows search based on what you tried
	- Source on GitHub, pull requests welcome
		- License is public domain like if you just grab some module code as an example and use it
		- Each module has view source button for tsx or resulting (formatted+commented) js.
	- Load and function as much as possible if Internet is down (and make it clear when in "offline mode" )
	- serve the original sources so source maps work deployed
	- works offline (PWA/manifest.json/background worker)
		- it it seems we should be online, if live load fails ask user if tey want to use the cached copy
	- modules can have alternate names and typing one in the URL takes us to the real module
		- and show a reccommended short name if appropriate e.g. "CameraAndMicrophone" tells you you can just use /camera or /mic
	- Firefox double-requests CSS?
	- sitemap.xml?
	- lookd/works decenty on mobile
	- serve modification time for caching, allow caching root
	- refactor <terminal> to a class


- modules
	- Touch/multitouch
	- midi
	- controller inputs (and haptics?)
	- Webgl and feature tests
	- Wasm test
	- Camera/mic check (and pick from multiple sources)
		- fullscreen the camera view if desired
		- can we do slow-mo capture?
		- Save audio clip (wav or mp3)
	- Basic speaker test, select an output, pan to any speaker (even past l/r)
	- Browser info:
		- User agent, and put a browsecap or related somewhere and tell what it says
		- List out all identifiable data we can did out of you browser.
	- Network tests:
		- Latency to assorted targets, dns lookup latency
			- (like to every amazon, google cloud, and Azur edatacenter)
		- (and use metrics to get page load times/etc)
		- latency test (open a handful of connections to local CloudFlare node running web workers, graph
		results and measure latency as you go, full duplex)
		- max packet size/MTU
		- bandwidth
			- burst a pile of UDP packets at different rates and track packet loss
			- how to serve that doesn't have notable cost?
				- https://www.measurementlab.net/develop/ ?
	- jot down notes, saved in browser, can export/import
		- update when changed in another tab
		- bonus: option to save data by unique, random user key, keep changes on server for a week, other browsers with same key update their notes from sever ("No expectation of privacy", liability terms)
		- bonus: log into an oauth, like Google, and we'll save the data on their server
	- maybe have links to repl.it
	- IP, user agent, local ip, server ip, other such data we can glean from server or client
	- My favorite computer porgrams/settings
		- .bashrc (history writing, colors, autocompletion)
		- Altdrag, clasic start menu, greenshot, superf4, wirtuawin, console (2 or z)
			- any good porfile settings I tweak, or a .zip
	- Speech api test
	- Web workers test? Maybe give out a performance number?
	- Web serial, webusb, Web bluetooth
	- Other special browser apis?
	- link to browser spectre tests
	- New/exotic image formats (jpeg2000, apng, webp, flif, avif, jxl, etc.)
	- Color space, hdr check/test
	- Simple binary viewer/editor
	- Unicode codepoint lookup, also ASCII lookup
	- Random number, lines shuffle, using rand() with link to random.org
	- time.is, but without ads
		 - could we use time.cloudflare.com and CloudFlare workers?
			 - doesn't look like it for UDP (NTP)
			 - maybe spin up a t5g.nano/lightsail to do time sync, have it aggressively follow a stratum 0 server. (can also use for bandwidth, packet loss tests)
			 	- then have it source NTP packet data, but send it to the browser over WebRTC so we can benefit its underlying timing trick
			 		- ...can a lambda function send (and recieve replies to) UDP data while running? Could we possibly do everything in a 1-2s burst? (And if it gets enough traffic then do a lightsail)
			 			- https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/faqs/ says "Inbound network connections are blocked ..., and for outbound connections only TCP/IP and UDP/IP sockets are supported," so if we originate the connection, maybe yes.
	- Tar command line builder (and xkcd joke)
	- file hash calculation (drag and drop, automatically states if hashes match (or if they are exactly binary equal), or better yet, if the aren't equal calculate a number of hashes and warn about any collisions, or if just doing sums warn about slimiar not not exact hashes (esp. if more than 1 start or end chars match))
	- WebRTC file transfer (server only helps the connection get started, files are 100% P2P between open browser windows, refuse to proxy packets through server if clients can't directly connect)
		- wonder if we can do this with Lambda functions and no data storage
		- and wile you can have the connection, might as well allow chatting
	- quick lookup for port numbers, mime-types
	- quick search box that starts focused, type a few letters of the module you want to interact, hit enter
	- load a remote site (as server), render image or pdf, show load timings, link to load speed sites, pick a place to request from?, inject cookies or headers?
		- and/or basic curl-style tester
		- needs rate/bandwidth/cpu limit
	- http "connect to any port" test (link)
	- post+cookies+other storage data endpoint/echo
	- quick api reference, for example rmemberinf in python you make a directory with os.mkdir
	- http status: what http proocol we used to load the page (e.g. http/3)
		- https://gf.dev/http3-test
	- enter specific date/time, show countdown (and the url can be re-used/shared)
	- js minifier/deep minifier
	- a certain URL that you use curl {url} | bash to run performance testing (sysbench, etc) on a USB-booted Linux system
	- Display tests: links to testufo, lagom.nl, rtings.com
	- Encding tool: encode/decode: URL, HTML chars, base64, rot13, binary ("1010" => ASCII), etc.
	- image crunching (like tinypng, but everything is done client-side) and conversion (also client-side, change image formats, including to newer web formats)
	- https://www.h-schmidt.net/FloatConverter/IEEE754.html
	- https://d3ward.github.io/toolz/src/adblock.html
	- 360 potato viewer
	- What API does testufo use to note monitor refresh rate, primary monitor, etc.
	- Special input types (color picker, phone number text entry, etc.)
	- Calculator: Possible to put SpeedCrunch or the like up for easy access?
	- Sign generator: just type some text pick fg/bg colors and display it giant and fullscreen

	- Serial:
		- add option to choose text encoding for send/recv (including hex and base64)
		- upload file, save recv'd data to file
		- pick line ending when you hit enter (\r, \n, \r\n, none)
		- webusb fallback?
	- user media:
		- access screen too
